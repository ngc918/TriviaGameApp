# Project 5 - Trivia Game App

Submitted by: Nicola Gonzalez

Trivia Game is an app that lets you answer questions of different formats and categories. The questions can vary in difficulty. The app also allows you to adjust the amount of questions it can ask you.

Time spent: 60 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App launches to an Options screen where user can modify the types of questions presented when the game starts. Users should be able to choose:
  - [X] Number of questions
  - [X] Category of questions
  - [X] Difficulty of questions
  - [X] Type of questions (Multiple Choice or True False)
- [X] User can tap a button to start trivia game, this presents questions and answers in a List or Card view.
  - Hint: For Card view visit your FlashCard app. List view is an equivalent to UITableView in UIKit. Much easier to use!
- [X] Selected choices are marked as user taps their choice (but answered is not presented yet!)
- [X] User can submit choices and is presented with a score on trivia game
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User has answer marked as correct or incorrect after submitting choices (alongside their score).
- [ ] Implement a timer that puts pressure on the user! Choose any time that works and auto submit choices after the timer expires. 

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Displaying at the end how many correct answers the player recieved.
- Making it where once the player is done with their questions, returns the player to the home screen.
- Sometimes when clicking on the answer choices, the button isn't very responsive. Not sure if that's the code or an Xcode issue.
